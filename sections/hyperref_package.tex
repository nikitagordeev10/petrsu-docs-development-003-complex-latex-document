\section{Пакет Hyperref}

This will be an empty chapter and I will put some text here

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i x^i
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{eq:1} shows a sum that is divergent. This formula will be later used on page \pageref{second}.

For further references see \href{https://kappa.cs.petrsu.ru/~chistyak/documentation/}{\textcolor{red}{cs.petrsu.ru}} or go to the next url: \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/} or open the next file.

It's also possible to link directly any word or \hyperlink{thesentence}{any sentence} in your document.

If you read this text, you will get no information.  Really?  Is there no information?

For instance \hypertarget{thesentence}{this sentence}.
